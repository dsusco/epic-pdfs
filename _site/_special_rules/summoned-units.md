Each formation in a Chaos army owes allegiance to Chaos Undivided or one of the four chaos gods: Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh or Tzeentch. The Chaos player must declare each formation's allegiance before the battle, noting it down on their army list. Unbroken formations with Daemonic Pact are able to summon daemons with a similar allegiance to the battlefield from the Daemon Pool.

Daemons in the Daemon Pool are noted only as being lesser or greater daemons when they are purchased, they should be thought of as markers. The Chaos player must declare the number of lesser and greater daemons in the Daemon Pool in some fashion that is easily apparent to their opponent at all times. The Daemon Pool is kept off the board and daemons are removed from it as formations summon daemons to the battlefield.

A formation may summon daemonic units from the Daemon Pool as part of its action before declaring which action it will carry out. The formation generates 2d3 summoning points that can be used to move daemons from the Daemon Pool to the battlefield where they are converted to actual daemonic units. The allegiance of the summoning formation determines which daemonic units it may summon, while the daemonic units available to summon (and their respective summoning point costs) are defined in the specific Chaos army lists. Summoning points must be used immediately or lost, but un-summoned daemons in the Daemon Pool remain to be summoned by other formations or on later turns.

Summoned daemonic units must be placed within 5cm of a unit from the formation that was there prior to summoning, you may not place a <q>chain</q> of summoned units. They also may not be placed in enemy zone of control or in impassable terrain. Finally, an army may only have one greater daemon with a given allegiance on the battlefield at any one time. Summoned daemonic units count as part of the formation that summoned them while they remain on the battlefield.

Daemonic units that are destroyed are removed from play and not put back into the Daemon Pool. If a formation with daemonic units is broken then all the daemonic units are removed from play as well. If a formation with daemonic units loses an assault (see [Work Out Result](https://tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/#work-out-result)) the extra hits it suffers occur before it becomes broken and the daemonic units are removed from play. Also note that daemonic units _do_ count towards the <q>For each kill you have inflicted during the assault</q> assault modifier of your opponent.

In the End phase, after all rally tests, all summoned daemonic units are converted back into daemon markers and returned to the Daemon Pool. Note that this may lead to the formation breaking. War Engine units that are returned to the Daemon Pool keep their current DC and do not heal back to full DC. If they are summoned again they will have the same DC they had before being returned to the Daemon Pool.
